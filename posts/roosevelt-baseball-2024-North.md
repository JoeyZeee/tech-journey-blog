Today we played a double header against North High School. North is statistically the worst baseball team in all of Iowa, and possibly the worst team in the United States. They don't have enough players to field an entire team, so some players play 4 games a day. All of their players are complete trash and some of them don't even know how to play the game.

I got subbed in at 2nd base and got walked in the first game. Then I played right field, got my first hit of the season (1 hit, 6 walks up until this point), with 2 RBIs. Did I make an error in the outfield causing two runs to score and us to run poles? Yes, yes I did.
