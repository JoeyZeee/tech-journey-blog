Today is my last two games (doubleheader) of the season since I am visiting California for two weeks, which will go past the end of the season. Currently, were two games under .500 and hoping to get to .500 by beating Lincoln twice since they suck even more ass than us.

I got in to pinch run in the first game and didnt have the chance to steal any bases since our batters suck. We crushed that game but got destroyed in the second game. In that game tho I got subbed in to play second base and got walked and then stole 2nd base to end my sohpmore season. 

Lowkey a pretty shitty season and this game sucks idk if I want to do this shit again.
